        <h3>Why does this exist, what do people gain from this?</h3>
        <p>It exists to mass-promote and to scam people. In commercial use,
spam could be used to potentially gain customers, but in it's annoying nature, it may also lose some.
In scam use, scammers could gain lots of things, personal info, passwords, bank accounts, locations,
etc. all with the click of a link. People who recieve spam, aren't likely to gain anything, rather
they may lose something important instead.</p>
