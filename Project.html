        <h3>How it affects coding/online culture</h3>
        <p> If a coder were to get spammed, despite their smart minds, If
they were to click a link, they might lose a lot/all progress on a project. Spamming has the same
effect on online culture as well, in which usually everyone can agree that it's very annoying and no
one likes it when they lose progress/give out personal info</p>
